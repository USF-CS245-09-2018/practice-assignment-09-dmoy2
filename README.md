# CS 245 (Fall 2018) Practice Assignment 09

See assignment details on Canvas.

I've implemented the code as efficient as possible, but sometimes I would fail the timing test. When using the IDE to execute my code. 
Most of the time; however, the time it takes to run the program would not exceed 30ms. But because the practice test driver only accepts times less than 20ms, the program would return failed timing test. 
It may just be my computer's processor, but for the most part, the program runs fairly fast around 17-30ms.

UPDATE: when testing my program on the terminal, I've always passed the time test with times around 10-20ms. It must be the IDE that's making the time slower.
